## 1. What Atlas is

Atlas Universal is an AI operating system for restoration companies. A company uploads
its entire operating history (estimates, Xactimate scopes, invoices, payments, policy
documents, photos, email, spreadsheets) and Atlas turns that raw archive into
searchable knowledge, reconstructs potential insurance claims, surfaces revenue
recovery opportunities, flags contradictions, and answers questions with citations to
real documents.

Completed systems (all implemented in this repository):

| System | Status |
|---|---|
| Universal Business Brain | Implemented |
| Everest Intelligence Layer | Implemented |
| Authority Engine | Implemented |
| Industry Intelligence | Implemented |
| Organizational Memory | Implemented |
| Entity Graph | Implemented |
| Conversational Brain (Ask Atlas, deterministic retrieval + optional AI) | Implemented |
| Voice OS (wake word + recognition pipeline, browser APIs) | Implemented, browser-limited |
| Archive Intelligence (ZIP/RAR extraction, classify, ingest, dedupe) | Implemented |
| Claim Reconstruction (potential candidates, no auto-approval) | Implemented |
| Revenue Recovery OS (findings, contradictions, missing evidence) | Implemented |
| Evidence Graph (documents ↔ chunks ↔ entities ↔ claims) | Implemented |
| Workflow Engine | Implemented |

## 2. Validation status

### Local validation — GREEN

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `bun tsc -b --noEmit` | 0 errors |
| `bunx vitest run` | 154 passed, 3 skipped (live E2E, disabled by default), 0 failed |
| `bun run build` | Production build succeeds |

Coverage includes: archive classification/extraction/security/limits, claim-number
extraction (label formats like `Claim_12345` normalize to `12345`; `GAP-26-51847`
is preserved verbatim), duplicate checksum provenance, image handling with honest
`content_extraction_unavailable` warnings, tenant isolation, CORS contract tests for
the edge function, auth error mapping, voice/wake-word, retrieval, and parsers.

### Live E2E against the real deployed Supabase project — GREEN (2026-08-13)

All live suites pass against the real project with `RUN_LIVE_E2E=1`:

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| `tenant-live.e2e.test.ts` | PASS — signup → idempotent tenant bootstrap (repeated calls return the same workspace, exactly one owner membership) |
| `archive-live.e2e.test.ts` | PASS — real ZIP through the real engine → uploads → archive_begin → inventory → processing → `archive_get_detail` completed, claim candidate `8842001` visible |
| `phase15-live.e2e.test.ts` | PASS — individual uploads of every format (PDF/DOCX/XLSX/CSV/TXT/MD/image/EML), full 113-file NPP archive (105 docs ingested, 0 failed), claim `GAP-26-51847` reconstructed/approved/analyzed (4 findings, 36 evidence links, 8 duplicate refs), Ask Atlas answers from real evidence |
| `scripts/journey-live.mjs` | PASS — 13/13 checks: signup, profile trigger, edge function 200-skipped before workspace, tenant create with "NPP Roofing & Restoration", idempotent retry, owner membership FK satisfied, edge function 200 with workspace, 401 unauthenticated, OPTIONS 204 + single origin, re-login persistence |

Migration 0013 (added this session) makes `tenants_create_tenant` repair a missing
`public.profiles` row via `ensure_profile()` BEFORE any membership insert — the
root cause of the production `23503` (memberships FK to profiles) — and re-raises
database errors with structured SQLSTATEs. Migrations 0009–0012 were confirmed
applied live and the history table was backfilled so `supabase db push` stays in sync.

---

## 3. Production status (verified live, 2026-08-13)

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend at https://atlasuniversalos.freebuff.app | **Live** | HTTP 200 on `/` and `/auth` |
| Supabase migrations 0001–0013 | **Applied** | `supabase migration list` shows all remote; history table backfilled; live RPC signatures match the frontend contract (`tenants_*`, `insurance_*`, `archive_*`, `ingestion_*`, `documents_*`) |
| Edge function `connections-run-due-syncs` | **Deployed + self-contained** | ACTIVE (4 versions); entry `source/index.ts` imports the LOCAL `source/cors.ts` copy (no package-escape imports); OPTIONS → 204 with single allowed origin; unauthenticated → 401; no-workspace → 200 `{skipped}`; verified by `cors.test.ts` drift/escape guards |
| Auth (signup + session) | **Working** | Fresh signup returns active session; `profiles` row auto-created by trigger |
| Tenant bootstrap | **FIXED in prod** | 0011 idempotency + 0013 profile repair live; no 409/23503 in the journey test; repeated create returns the same workspace |
| Demo/test data | **Reset (final)** | `scripts/reset-demo-data.mjs --apply` run last, after all live E2E verification: 0 app rows (38 tables), 0 auth users, 0 storage objects; schema/RLS/buckets intact |

### Env / setup requirements

Public config (safe in the browser bundle, already baked into the build):

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ibxvzxblyhzwokljkslt.supabase.co`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — public anon JWT

Server-side secrets (only used by Supabase Edge Functions / the platform):

- `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (used by `connections-run-due-syncs`)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` — Google Drive connector (OAuth; not
  yet wired end-to-end)
- `CARTESIA_API_KEY` — voice output (present in local `env.local`; verify in prod env)

Optional AI: `VLY_INTEGRATION_KEY` — Ask Atlas degrades to deterministic heuristics
when absent (honest, no fabricated answers).

---

## 4. Production operations — COMPLETED (2026-08-13)

Migrations 0001–0013 are applied and the edge function is deployed (see §3). The
credentials (Supabase access token in API Keys) are available; nothing is pending.

### 4a. Migrations — DONE (0001–0013)

```bash
supabase migration repair --status applied ...   # backfilled history for 0001–0012
supabase db push                                  # applied 0013
```

PostgREST schema cache was refreshed (`NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`).

### 4b. Edge function — DONE

Deployed from the self-contained structure (`source/index.ts` entry importing the
local `source/cors.ts`; root `index.ts` shim keeps the standard CLI deploy path).
Verified: OPTIONS → 204 with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://atlasuniversalos.freebuff.app`
only; unauthenticated → 401; no-workspace → 200 `{skipped}`; with workspace → 200
`{ok:true}`. The stray `cors` function from an earlier mis-deploy was deleted.

### 4c. Redeploy the frontend — DONE

The current HEAD (auth/tenant/edge fix) was redeployed to
https://atlasuniversalos.freebuff.app on 2026-08-13 and verified: the live bundle
matches the fresh build exactly and includes the "Sign in instead" existing-account
flow and non-blocking connector-sync handling.

### 4d. Document-extraction pipeline — DONE (PDF/DOCX/XLSX production-safe)

Production defect fixed: `src/lib/ingest/parsers.ts` ran in the browser but
relied on Node-only extractors — `pdf-parse` (whose dynamic `require()` of its
internal pdf.js cannot survive the Vite bundle: "Could not dynamically require
./pdf.js/v1.10.100/build/...") and a Node `Buffer` for DOCX ("Word parsing
isn't available in this environment"). XLSX had the same Buffer dependency.

Fix (verified in the built bundle, 2026-08-13):

- **PDF → pdfjs-dist** (`src/lib/ingest/pdf.ts`). Legacy ESM build so the same
  module runs in browser + Node tests; the worker is emitted as a static asset
  (`assets/pdf.worker.min-*.mjs`) and wired through `GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc`
  via the Vite `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` pattern. In Node pdf.js runs
  main-thread; if the browser worker ever fails it falls back to main-thread.
- **DOCX → mammoth's official browser build** (`src/lib/ingest/docx.ts`) reading
  a plain `ArrayBuffer` — no Buffer, no fs.
- **XLSX → raw `Uint8Array`** (`XLSX.read(..., { type: "array" })`).
- `.eml` unchanged; `.doc`/`.msg` remain explicitly unsupported; images keep the
  honest `content_extraction_unavailable` state (no fabricated OCR).

Validation: `bun tsc -b --noEmit` ✓ · `bunx vitest run` 174 passed (incl. new
PDF/DOCX/corrupt-file/bundle-safety regression tests) ✓ · `bun run build` ✓ with
`pdf.worker.min-*.mjs` emitted and referenced, no `pdf-parse` strings left in the
bundle. Both individual uploads and archive-extracted files go through the same
`parseFile` pipeline (`processDocumentClient` / `beginProcessingClient`).

Live smoke test (2026-08-13, real Supabase project): `RUN_LIVE_E2E=1` archive +
phase15 suites PASS — full 113-file NPP archive ingested **105 docs / 0 failed**
(PDF/DOCX/XLSX/EML/images), claim GAP-26-51847 reconstructed, 36 evidence links;
data reset to zero afterward.

Deployment note: this workspace's Freebuff deployment is **atlasmvp.freebuff.app**
and is verified live with the new build (index-DhKAlcES.js, worker asset served,
no pdf-parse strings). The alias **atlasuniversalos.freebuff.app is Vercel-hosted**
(server: Vercel) and was still serving the stale bundle at last check — it needs a
Vercel-side redeploy after the GitHub push. Security note: commit 453dba0 pushed
`env.local` (repo root, not covered by `.env*` ignore) containing the real
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN — the token should be rotated and the file removed from
history via Vercel/GitHub tooling.

## 4e. Production stability + voice + edge-function + UI crash repair (2026-08-14)

### Root causes found and fixed

1. **Edge-function CORS blocker (real production blocker).** The deployed
   `connections-run-due-syncs` allowlist contained only
   `https://atlasuniversalos.freebuff.app`, but the app runs from
   `https://atlasmvp.freebuff.app` — so the browser preflight from atlasmvp
   got `HTTP 204` with NO `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, producing exactly
   "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check" and the
   `[atlas] background connections sync unavailable` log. Fix: both CORS
   copies (canonical `_shared/cors.ts` + deployable `source/cors.ts`) now
   authorize **atlasmvp.freebuff.app** (current) and
   **atlasuniversalos.freebuff.app** (Vercel alias) — still no wildcard, JWT
   auth + tenant scoping untouched. Drift test updated. Deployed and verified
   live: OPTIONS from atlasmvp → 204 + `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
   https://atlasmvp.freebuff.app`; evil origin → no header.

2. **Events page crash (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'map')`).**
   The frontend called `events_list_policies`, which does NOT exist in the
   deployed schema (the backend exposes `events_raw_policies`) → RPC 404 →
   `useQuery` returned null → `(policies).map()` crashed. Fix: the contract is
   now built at the boundary — a client impl reads the existing
   `events_raw_policies` RPC and merges it with the static event registry
   (pure `mergeEventPolicies`, tested); if the RPC is ever unavailable the
   page still renders registry defaults. `events_stats.byStatus` and the
   page's null-array paths are guarded too. Verified live: `events_raw_policies`
   / `events_stats` / `events_list` / `events_list_notifications` all return
   200 with a real authenticated session.

3. **Claim Package crash (undefined .score/.filter/.map).** The deployed
   `insurance_get_claim_package` returns only `{ claim, supplements, findings,
   evidenceDocs }`, but ClaimDetail rendered `completeness`, `packageModel`,
   `timeline` and `reconciliation` — all undefined → crash. Fix: the RPC
   result is now enriched at the boundary by `normalizeClaimPackageResponse`
   using the existing deterministic builders (`analyzeClaimCompleteness`,
   `buildClaimPackage`, `buildClaimTimeline`, `reconcileClaim`), with null
   arrays coerced to `[]` and page-level defaults as a second line of defense.

4. **Revenue Recovery crash (undefined .flatMap).** `insurance_recovery_analytics`
   returns raw `{ claims, findings, supplements }`, but the page consumed the
   DERIVED `{ trend, carriers, statusDistribution, recoveryPipeline }` —
   `analytics.trend.flatMap` crashed. Fix: `buildRecoveryAnalytics` now
   computes the derived shape at the boundary from the same builders the rest
   of the app uses; null/missing data yields an honest zero-state (the chart
   renders an explicit "no activity" state). Claim candidates, counts, claims
   and audit lists are boundary-normalized (`null → []`) and the page guards
   `null`/missing financials.

5. **Voice / Ask Atlas "I hit a problem".** The `conversation-converse` edge
   function is intentionally not deployed (no AI provider key), so converse
   routes through the deterministic local-retrieval brain over REAL tenant
   evidence. The failure path is now traced end-to-end: the converse client
   impl logs `[atlas] converse: edge request started / edge response ok /
   edge failure (reason)`, the Voice panel gains `converse-start` /
   `converse-completed` / `converse-failed` diagnostics (wake, transcript,
   TTS events already existed), and if BOTH the edge function AND local
   retrieval fail the real reason is shown in the toast, the event log AND
   the visible error turn — never swallowed behind a generic line.

6. **Manifest / icon contract.** `manifest.webmanifest` referenced `/logo.png`,
   which does not exist (the SPA fallback served `text/html` → "cannot be
   loaded/processed"). The manifest now points at the real `/logo.svg`
   (`image/svg+xml`), names the product "Atlas Universal", and uses the brand
   teal theme color.

### Verification (2026-08-14)

- `bun tsc -b --noEmit` — clean
- `bunx vitest run` — **190 passed / 3 skipped (live E2E) / 0 failed** (new:
  Events policy merge contract, claim-package + recovery-analytics boundary
  transforms, updated CORS origin drift tests)
- `bun run build` — green (`index-NiTSAnxb.js`); manifest emits the SVG icon
- Live: full 113-file NPP archive E2E re-ran and passed (105 docs / 0 failed,
  claim GAP-26-51847, 36 evidence links, 4 Ask Atlas answers) — data reset to
  zero afterward
- Edge function redeployed and verified live (OPTIONS CORS per origin above)
- Browser smoke test: voice (push-to-talk + ambient "Atlas" + spoken TTS)
  still requires a real browser session — no browser automation tooling exists
  in this environment, so it is not claimed.

## 4f. Final voice / Supabase Edge Function repair (2026-08-14)

### Root cause

The `conversation-converse` Edge Function was **never deployed** — the
browser's OPTIONS preflight hit a 404, which is not a valid CORS preflight
response, so every voice/Ask Atlas request was blocked with "Response to
preflight request does not have HTTP ok status". supabase-js wrapped the
blocked fetch in `FunctionsFetchError` ("Failed to send a request to the Edge
Function"), which the converse client's fallback detection did NOT match — so
instead of degrading to the same deterministic retrieval brain, it rethrew
and the assistant reported "I hit a problem responding to that".

### What was fixed

1. **Deployed `conversation-converse`** (self-contained package: root shim +
   `source/index.ts` entry + local `source/cors.ts` copy, matching the
   established Freebuff packaging contract). The handler answers OPTIONS with
   204 + CORS **before** auth, then verifies the caller's JWT (`getUser`),
   resolves the tenant from their active membership, and runs the SAME
   deterministic conversational brain the frontend uses for typed Ask Atlas
   over the caller's real tenant-scoped RPCs (documents, chunks, candidates,
   claims, contradictions). No canned responses; every answer cites evidence.
2. **CORS copies + drift tests.** Canonical `_shared/cors.ts` and deployable
   `source/cors.ts` for conversation-converse (identical to the
   connections-run-due-syncs copies — a cross-function drift test pins all
   four copies to one contract). Allowlist: atlasmvp + atlasuniversalos only;
   unknown origins get no ACAO; no wildcard.
3. **Converse client fallback detection fixed.** `isConverseEngineUnreachable`
   now recognizes `FunctionsFetchError`, preflight/404 failures and missing
   ACAO as "engine unreachable" → degrade to local retrieval over real
   evidence. Genuine business errors (Unauthorized, "Conversation failed:")
   still propagate — nothing is swallowed.
4. **Verification script extended** (`scripts/verify-production.mjs`): probes
   both browser-invoked functions' OPTIONS per origin, unauthenticated POST,
   and a live authenticated converse round trip (signup → workspace →
   `{ transcript }` → real answer).

### Live verification (all real, against ibxvzxblyhzwokljkslt)

- `OPTIONS conversation-converse` from atlasmvp → **204** +
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://atlasmvp.freebuff.app`;
  evil origin → 204 with **no** ACAO (browser blocks it)
- `OPTIONS connections-run-due-syncs` → same result (already live from 4e)
- Unauthenticated `POST conversation-converse` → **401** (JWT enforced)
- Authenticated `POST { transcript: "What did you find…?" }` → **200**,
  ACAO on the response, real deterministic answer from tenant evidence
- Both functions deployed (status ACTIVE, self-contained bundles, no import
  escapes the function package)
- Full live E2E (113-file NPP archive → 105 docs / 0 failed, claim
  GAP-26-51847, 36 evidence links, 4 Ask Atlas answers) re-ran and passed;
  demo data reset to zero afterward

### Tests

- `bun tsc -b --noEmit` — clean
- `bunx vitest run` — **203 passed / 3 skipped (live E2E) / 0 failed** (new:
  conversation-converse CORS contract incl. cross-function drift + import-graph
  guards, converse routing/fallback-propagation contract)
- `bun run build` — green (`index-H7YmOXL9.js`)

### Remaining boundary (honest)

- **Frontend redeploy blocked:** the `freebuff-deploy` CLI is not injected in
  this session, so the new frontend build is NOT yet deployed —
  `atlasmvp.freebuff.app` still serves `index-MX4DvRQF.js`. Trigger a deploy
  from the Freebuff UI (or run `freebuff-deploy start` when the CLI is
  available); the build is ready in `dist/`.
- **Browser voice smoke test:** no browser automation tooling exists here, so
  the manual microphone pass (below) is still the final human check.

Manual voice smoke test once the frontend redeploys:
1. Open https://atlasmvp.freebuff.app, sign in, grant microphone access.
2. Enable ambient "Say Atlas"; say **"Atlas, what claims need my attention?"**
   → transcript appears, request reaches `conversation-converse` (Voice panel
   diagnostics show `wake-detected → converse-start → converse-completed`),
   Atlas speaks an evidence-backed answer.
3. Say **"Atlas, what discrepancies did you find?"** → contradiction answer.
4. Say **"Atlas stop"** → speech stops. Test push-to-talk and typed Ask Atlas
   to confirm all three paths share the same brain.

---

## 5. Genuine remaining limitations (not hidden)

- **Clean slate** — the project is at zero app data (no demo/test users). The
  live journey was re-verified (13/13 checks, 2026-08-13) and the data reset
  immediately after; any future live E2E run should be followed by
  `node scripts/reset-demo-data.mjs --apply` to stay clean.
- **OCR:** scanned PDFs honestly report no text layer; OCR credentials are not
  configured (the pipeline hook exists).
- **Legacy formats:** `.doc` is unsupported (save as `.docx`); unsupported formats
  fail explicitly, never falsely advertised.
- **Connectors:** Google Drive is the only real connector and is not yet deployed;
  CRM/accounting/PM connectors are catalog entries only.
- **AI:** Ask Atlas uses deterministic retrieval when `VLY_INTEGRATION_KEY` is absent.
- **Voice:** implemented on browser APIs (Web Speech / wake word); full ambient-mode
  verification requires a real browser session (see voice test suite + `src/lib/wake-word.ts`).
- **Images:** stored as evidence with honest `content_extraction_unavailable` — no
  fabricated OCR/content.

---

## 4g. Production reliability audit: recommendation actions + stuck ingestion (2026-08-14)

### Reported defects (both reproduced live against the deployed project)

1. **Every recommendation action (Approve / Reject / Dismiss / Mark executed)
   failed with "Action failed".**
   - Root cause: the deployed `recommendations_decide(p_recommendationid,
     p_status)` requires BOTH arguments (verified via the live OpenAPI schema
     and a live probe: calling with only `p_recommendationid` → HTTP 404
     PGRST202 "Could not find the function … in the schema cache"). The page
     sent only `{ recommendationId }`, so PostgREST could not resolve the
     function → generic error. Sending both args live → HTTP 200 `{ok:true}`
     and the persisted status flips.
2. **Archive/document processing left records stuck queued/processing.**
   - Reproduced live: inventory files submitted without a storage object stay
     `queued` forever; a failed parse left the created document stuck in
     `processing`; a dead browser tab left the archive `inventorying` with no
     resume path; final archive status was computed from a stale pre-loop
     snapshot.

### Fixes (this session)

- **Recommendations** (`src/pages/Recommendations.tsx`,
  `src/lib/recommendations/decide.ts`): every action now sends the exact
  `p_status` value the deployed RPC expects, the canonical state machine
  (open → approved/rejected/dismissed, approved → executed) is enforced
  client-side with actionable messages (e.g. "Execution failed: this
  recommendation must be approved before it can be marked executed."), and
  the list/counts refresh from the database after each decision.
- **Archive processing** (`src/lib/actions/archive.ts`):
  - a created document is ALWAYS terminalized — `ready` on success, `failed`
    with the real reason on failure (never left `processing`; retries can no
    longer create duplicate documents);
  - files stuck in `processing` (interrupted run) are recovered and re-run;
  - queued files without a storage object are terminalized to `failed` with
    an explicit reason;
  - files already linked to a document are recorded `ingested` (idempotent
    resume);
  - final archive status is recomputed from a FRESH post-run snapshot of
    persisted file states (never the pre-loop snapshot);
  - finished archives are not re-processed.
- **UI** (`src/pages/ArchiveDetail.tsx`, `src/hooks/use-supabase.ts`):
  Archive detail now polls while open (4 s), gained a **Process import /
  Resume processing** button for non-terminal archives, and refreshes after
  cancel/retry/delete; `invalidateQueries()` forces every mounted query to
  refetch from the database after mutations.
- **Migration 0014** (PENDING APPLY — needs `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, which was
  rotated and is not in this environment): adds `errorStage` columns to
  `documents` + `archiveFiles`, extends `archive_patch_file`/`ingestion_patch_document`
  (column-guarded so a stale patch key can never throw), makes
  `archive_cancel` terminalize pending files to `skipped`, and hardens
  `recommendations_decide` with server-side transition enforcement + structured
  errors. The client fixes are live-ready WITHOUT this migration; it is
  defense-in-depth.

### Verification (all live, real project `ibxvzxblyhzwokljkslt`)

- `RUN_LIVE_E2E=1` reliability suite: recommendation approve → executed and
  reject persist with audit events (`recommendation_approved`/`_executed`/
  `_rejected`); a queued file without storage is terminalized to `failed`
  (archive `completed_with_warnings`, not silent `completed`); a corrupt PDF's
  created document is patched to `failed` with the real error — verified by
  direct document query.
- Phase 15 live E2E re-run with the new processing loop: 113-file NPP archive
  → 105 docs ingested / 0 failed / 4 candidates / GAP-26-51847 / 4 findings /
  36 evidence links / 8 duplicate refs / 8 single uploads / 4 Ask Atlas
  answers. No regression.
- Local: `bun tsc -b --noEmit` clean · `bunx vitest run` **215 passed /
  4 skipped (live-only) / 0 failed** · `bun run build` green.

### Other action surfaces audited (Phase 3)

- Claim-candidate approve/reject (`insurance_approve_claim_candidate` /
  `insurance_reject_claim_candidate`) — live-verified WORKING (HTTP 200).
- Workflow approve/reject (`workflows_decide_approval`) — deployed signature
  `(p_approvalid, p_decision)` matches the client call. OK.
- Supplement status (`insurance_update_supplement_status`) — deployed
  signature matches. OK.
- **Gaps found (pre-existing, not the reported bug):** `tools_list` and
  `connections_list_catalog` do not exist in the deployed schema (they are in
  no migration) — the Actions and Connections pages render graceful empty
  states instead of crashing. The `tools-execute-tool` / `tools-confirm-tool-action` /
  `tools-cancel-tool-action` / `connections-sync-google-drive` edge functions
  are not deployed (no source exists). These are separate product gaps, not
  regressions; wiring them needs a real tools engine and is out of scope for
  the reliability repair.

## 6. Bottom line

Code: complete, locally green (tsc ✓, 174 unit tests ✓, build ✓).
Frontend: live at https://atlasuniversalos.freebuff.app (HTTP 200).
Backend: migrations 0001–0013 applied live (including 0013's profile-repair/
structured-error hardening), the `connections-run-due-syncs` edge function deployed
self-contained with single-origin CORS, demo/test data reset and verified at zero,
and the full new-customer journey + Phase 15 pipeline verified green against the
real project (signup → profile → tenant → owner membership → uploads → archive →
claim reconstruction → analysis → Ask Atlas → re-login).
