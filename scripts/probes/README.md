# scripts/probes — development-only live verification probes

This directory holds **development tooling only**. Nothing in here ships in the
production build.

## What these are

Live probes that drive the **deployed Supabase project** the same way the
frontend does, using throwaway sign-ups + workspaces, and print only shapes,
statuses and counts — never secrets. Every probe cleans up every row it
creates (documents, candidates, claims, evidence links, findings,
supplements, memberships, tenant, user) in a `finally` block.

- `probe-claim-materialization.mjs` — end-to-end trace of the claim
  acceptance chain: document → candidate → approve → claim row → list →
  claim package → timeline → evidence linkage → reject (no claim) →
  double-approve (no duplicate) → cross-workspace isolation. 14 checks.
- `probe-approval-evidence.mjs` — does `insurance_approve_claim_candidate`
  auto-link the candidate's evidence documents to the created claim? What
  does the candidate row record after approval?
- `probe-claims-list-shape.mjs` — prints the exact raw rows the frontend
  receives from `insurance_list_claims` (keys + types, never values) to
  verify the API boundary contract.
- `probe-demo-chain-ask.mjs` — demo-dataset + Ask Atlas acceptance: seeds
  clearly-marked demo claims through the deployed RPCs (the client demo
  loader's contract), seeds one candidate via the ingestion upsert RPC so
  the approve flow runs inside this probe, creates grounded evidence
  documents + chunks (including a labeled estimate-vs-invoice pair for one
  claim so the discrepancy question exercises the real contradiction
  engine), drives claim list / package / evidence-attach, then asks the
  deployed `conversation-converse` function the three acceptance questions
  and verifies answers cite the actual workspace claims (and reports the
  Gemini status honestly — never fakes an AI answer). 18 checks.

Run any probe with:

```bash
node scripts/probes/<probe-name>.mjs
```

They read `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from `.env.local` (service key is used only for
cleanup deletes scoped to the probe's own tenant/rows). Exit code 0 means all
checks passed; 1 means a check failed. Never run against a project you don't
own — they create and delete real rows, but only inside throwaway tenants.

## Why they live here and not in the app

- They are verification tooling, not product features — keeping them in a
  dedicated `scripts/probes/` area makes the dev-only boundary explicit.
- The production build (`bun run build` → `vite build`) bundles only what
  `index.html` → `src/` imports; nothing under `scripts/` is imported by the
  app, so probes are **structurally excluded** from the build and from
  `tsc -b` (both tsconfigs only include `src/` and `vite.config.ts`). No
  extra exclusion config is required or added.
- They never print credentials; `.env.local` is gitignored and the secrets
  themselves are never committed.
