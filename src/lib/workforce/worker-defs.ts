// Atlas Workforce — Worker Catalog
//
// One Atlas workforce, six capability domains (matching the orchestrator's
// CapabilityDomain type). Each worker is a JOB FUNCTION over the same
// underlying entities — a claim can be worked by several workers at once.
// Worker pages are compositions of existing services, never new CRUD logic.
