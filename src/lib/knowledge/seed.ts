// Atlas Knowledge Layer — Seed Industry Knowledge
//
// Deterministic seed dataset representing Atlas's baseline industry knowledge
// for the U.S. insurance restoration / roofing / construction ecosystem.
//
// This is Layer 1 knowledge — shared across all customers. It is NOT
// customer-specific and does NOT contain any company's proprietary data.
//
// The seed covers:
//   - Insurance restoration terminology
//   - Claim lifecycle concepts
//   - Documentation requirements
//   - Evidence requirements per workflow stage
//   - Common industry roles
//   - Supplement concepts
//   - Revenue recovery concepts
//   - Industry risk patterns
//   - Regulatory awareness (OSHA, EPA, licensing)
//
// Provenance review notes:
//   - Items classified as ATLAS_CURATED with isInference: false represent
//     widely-accepted industry terminology or workflow descriptions.
//   - Items with isInference: true are Atlas heuristics — operational
//     patterns observed across the industry but not attributable to a
//     single authoritative source. These are lower confidence.
//   - Quantitative claims (e.g. "5-15%") are Atlas heuristics, not
//     sourced statistics.
//   - Causal claims (e.g. "most common reason for denial") are Atlas
//     observations, not peer-reviewed findings.
