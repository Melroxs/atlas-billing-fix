// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Atlas Universal — Connector Registry
//
// The single source of truth for every external system Atlas can connect to.
// Each entry describes a REAL platform: its actual authentication mechanism,
// required environment variables, OAuth scopes and capabilities. Nothing here
// is simulated.
//
// `implementationStatus` is the honest contract:
//   - "implemented" → a real client exists in this codebase (OAuth flow, sync
//     or test path wired to the provider's actual API).
//   - "planned"     → the provider's API/auth is documented and the registry
//     entry is complete, but the client has not been built yet. The UI shows
//     these as roadmap items — never as "Connected".
//
// Every connector must implement the same underlying contract
// (see connections.ts listConnectorCatalog + connectionsSync.ts testConnection).
